### My Mission

Hi, my name is Linling(沈琳玲). I am a graduate student and a badminton athlete. I am passionate to change the world to become more inclusive, moving it to understand and embrace neurodiversity, as neurodevelopmental disorders such as learning difficulties (e.g. reading difficulty and ADHD) and autism have become increasingly common in recent years. Individuals with such disorders face many barriers when entering mainstream society because of the communication deficits or poor academic performance. For example, autistic people might be misread by others as indifferent and unfriendly, while those who with learning difficulties might be treated as not smart or hard-working enough. As I knew more lovely children on the spectrum, reading difficulties and adults with learning disabilities through volunteering and teaching, I became more aware of those challenges they and their families face. Therefore, I am motivated to advocate reading difficulty acceptance and support in mainstream schools and the society.
